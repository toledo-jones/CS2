/*
Create a small C program that contains: a dummy structure called blank (a.k.a. a structure without any variables/values),
a dummy function (a.k.a. a function with two parameters, but no body).
The program will also contain a main function (this will be of type int, and will return 0).

The main function will have the following:
   a) Definitions for: an integer, a single character, and a structure definition of type blank.
   b) Pointer definitions for the integer, the character, the structure, for the dummy function, and a void pointer.
   c) Declare an array with three integers.
   d) Declare a new pointer variable called ptr (but do not assign it to anything).
   e) Assign the address of val[0] to ptr.
   f) Declare another pointer, called ptr2.
   g) Assign ptr to ptr2.
   h) Using the unary operator—the sizeof function, and printf, create a block of print statements. Each one will print out the size of a pointer you have created.
   i) Traverse the array using a for loop that goes from 0 to 5, and a printf statement that prints the location of: *ptr++.
What is going on in this loop?
What’s correct about this code?
Is there anything wrong with this code, and how can it be fixed?
   Include your answers in a printf statement block.
